                    <p>One of the advantages of using VSCode is its ability to integrate with Git, it’s easy and fast, another thing is its ability to integrate on different teams remotely, several developers can work on the same project, or even the same code by using this tool/extension: Visual Studio Live Share helps several developers to work together more efficiently, compared to Sublime Text and Atom.</p>
                    <ul>Pros:</ul>
                        <li>Lightweight, fast and Free &#33;. Simple and Clean User Interface, Built-in Terminal, Multiple Cursor</li>

                <u><h2>Atom</h2></u>
                    <p>Atom was started by Github’s genius developers, but now owned by Microsoft, the good thing about Atom is it’s free, it’s open-source and also highly customizable, the best part about atom is its Teletype feature, which allows several/multiple developers to work on the same project, on the same code, from every part of the world, on different location.</p>
                    <p>Atom is a bit similar to Sublime Text, but many developers who preferred Atom was because of its simple interface compared to Sublime Text.</p>
                    <ul>Pros:</ul>
                        <li>Atom is a desktop application for Web Technologies</li>
                        <li>It has Modular Design and contains more than 50 open-source extension/packages that you can integrate around a minimal core</li>
                        <li>Snippets</li>
                        <li>Clean and Simple User Interface</li>
                        <li>Node.js Integration</li>
                        <li>Hackable Approach</li>
                    <ul>Cons:</ul>
                        <li>It has some performance issues</li>
                        <li>It takes several seconds to launch compared to other Text Editor, especially when you install numerous packages/extensions.</li>
                        <li>A little slow compared to Sublime Text because it’s a browser-based app (this is run using Electron)</li>
